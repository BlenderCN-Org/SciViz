Here are some of the scripts and instructions for conversion of various data formats that we use at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center Scientific Visualization Group (http://goo.gl/S04WUk)

The folders are organized into what type of data you want to create (Voxels, particles, geometries, etc)
Inside each folder there are subfolders for the target program or original data format.

The tools are meant to be concatenated, in the Unix spirit (some even work using pipes!).
For example, if you want to see volumetric data (voxels) in Maya, you will instructions on how to convert to Maya fluid cache format from binary files, so look for a script that will convert the original data format (ASCII, HDF5) into binary first.
